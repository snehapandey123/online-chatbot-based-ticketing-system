Background: Visitors to museums often face several significant challenges due to manual ticket booking systems. One prominent issue is the inefficiency and time consumption associated with the process. Long queues are common, especially during peak hours, weekends, or special exhibitions, leading to frustration and impatience among visitors. Besides the wait times, the manual system is prone to errors, such as incorrect ticket issuance, double bookings, or lost records, which can cause further delays and inconvenience. Overall, these challenges associated with manual ticket booking systems significantly detract from the visitor experience, reducing satisfaction and potentially impacting the museum's reputation and visitor numbers.
